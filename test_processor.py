    Welcome to the RAG Chatbot Documentation

    This is a comprehensive guide to understanding and using our Retrieval-Augmented Generation system.

    What is RAG?
    RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's a powerful AI technique that combines:
    - Document retrieval systems
    - Large language models
    - Vector databases for semantic search

    How does it work?
    1. Documents are processed and split into chunks
    2. Each chunk is converted to a vector representation (embedding)
    3. When a user asks a question, we find the most relevant chunks
    4. These chunks are used as context for the AI to generate an answer

    Benefits of RAG:
    - Reduces hallucination in AI responses
    - Allows AI to work with specific, up-to-date information
    - Provides transparency by showing source material
    - Can be updated with new information without retraining

    This system is particularly useful for:
    - Customer support with product documentation
    - Internal knowledge management
    - Research assistance
    - Educational applications

    Frequently Asked Questions

    Q: How accurate is the RAG system?
    A: The accuracy depends on the quality of your source documents. Since RAG grounds its responses in real content, it's typically much more accurate than standalone language models.

    Q: What file formats are supported?
    A: Currently, we support PDF, DOCX, TXT, and Markdown files. More formats can be added as needed.

    Q: How do I add new documents?
    A: Simply place your documents in the data folder and restart the system. The ingestion process will automatically detect and process new files.

    Q: Can I use this system offline?
    A: The document processing and retrieval can work offline, but you'll need an internet connection for the language model API calls unless you use a local model.
